Problem Name: Rabbit Leap

Problem Statement:
In the rabbit leap problem, three east-bound rabbits stand in a line blocked by three west-bound rabbits. They are crossing a stream with stones placed in the east west direction in a line. There is one empty stone between them. Rabbits waiting to cross. Each rabbit can jump over one, but not more than that. How can they avoid getting into a deadlock? The rabbits can only move forward one step or two steps. They can jump over one rabbit if the need arises, but not more than that. Are they smart enough to cross each other without having to step into the water? Draw the state space for solving the problem.

Solution Space:
State space search is a method used widely in artificial intelligence and computer science to find a solution to a problem by searching through the set of possible states of the problem. Furthermore, a state space search algorithm uses the state space to navigate from the initial state to the goal state.

There can be infinite Solution space for a given Problem, let’s try to define the state space for our model by going through the solution.

Let the three East bank rabbits be represented by ‘E’ who wants to go to West bank and the three West bank rabbits be represented by ‘W’ who wants to go to the East bank.

As there are total of Nine stones between the East and West bank, to represent the  empty stone we use the ‘_’ symbol if the stone is empty.

From this Rabbit leap problem we get to know the following things.
=>how to define the state space for a solution.
=>Which algorithm should be used to find the optimal solution.
=>What is state for a particular system.
=>By defining the state space we can optimise the state space as well as the time required to find the optimal solution.
